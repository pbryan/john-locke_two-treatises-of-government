				<p epub:type="title">Of the Legislative, Executive, and Federative Power of the Common-Wealth</p>
			</hgroup>
			<p>THE <i>legislative</i> power is that, which has a right <i>to direct how the force of the common-wealth</i> shall be employed for preserving the community and the members of it. But because those laws which are constantly to be executed, and whose force is always to continue, may be made in a little time; therefore there is no need, that the <i>legislative</i> should be always in being, not having always business to do. And because it may be too great a temptation to human frailty, apt to grasp at power, for the same persons, who have the power of making laws, to have also in their hands the power to execute them, whereby they may exempt themselves from obedience to the laws they make, and suit the law, both in its making, and execution, to their own private advantage, and thereby come to have a distinct interest from the rest of the community, contrary to the end of society and government: therefore in well-ordered common-wealths, where the good of the whole is so considered, as it ought, the <i>legislative</i> power is put into the hands of divers persons, who duly assembled, have by themselves, or jointly with others, a power to make laws, which when they have done, being separated again, they are themselves subject to the laws they have made; which is a new and near tie upon them, to take care, that they make them for the public good.</p>
			<p>But because the laws, that are at once, and in a short time made, have a constant and lasting force, and need a <i>perpetual execution,</i> or an attendance thereunto; therefore it is necessary there should be a <i>power always in being,</i> which should see to the <i>execution</i> of the laws that are made, and remain in force. And thus the <i>legislative</i> and <i>executive power</i> come often to be separated.</p>
			<p>There is another <i>power</i> in every common-wealth, which one may call <i>natural,</i> because it is that which answers to the power every man naturally had before he entered into society: for though in a common-wealth the members of it are distinct persons still in reference to one another, and as such are governed by the laws of the society; yet in reference to the rest of mankind, they make one body, which is, as every member of it before was, still in the state of nature with the rest of mankind. Hence it is, that the controversies that happen between any man of the society with those that are out of it, are managed by the public; and an injury done to a member of their body, engages the whole in the reparation of it. So that under this consideration, the whole community is one body in the state of nature, in respect of all other states or persons out of its community.</p>
			<p>This therefore contains the power of war and peace, leagues and alliances, and all the transactions, with all persons and communities without the common-wealth, and may be called <i>federative,</i> if any one pleases. So the thing be understood, I am indifferent as to the name.</p>
			<p>These two powers, <i>executive</i> and <i>federative,</i> though they be really distinct in themselves, yet one comprehending the <i>execution</i> of the municipal laws of the society <i>within</i> its self, upon all that are parts of it; the other the management of the <i>security and interest of the public without,</i> with all those that it may receive benefit or damage from, yet they are always almost united. And though this <i>federative power</i> in the well or ill management of it be of great moment to the common-wealth, yet it is much less capable to be directed by antecedent, standing, positive laws, than the <i>executive;</i> and so must necessarily be left to the prudence and wisdom of those, whose hands it is in, to be managed for the public good: for the <i>laws</i> that concern subjects one amongst another, being to direct their actions, may well enough <i>precede</i> them. But what is to be done in reference to <i>foreigners,</i> depending much upon their actions, and the variation of designs and interests, must be <i>left</i> in great part <i>to</i> the <i>prudence</i> of those, who have this power committed to them, to be managed by the best of their skill, for the advantage of the common-wealth.</p>
			<p>Though, as I said, the <i>executive</i> and <i>federative power</i> of every community be really distinct in themselves, yet they are hardly to be separated, and placed at the same time, in the hands of distinct persons: for both of them requiring the force of the society for their exercise, it is almost impracticable to place the force of the common-wealth in distinct, and not subordinate hands; or that the <i>executive</i> and <i>federative power</i> should be <i>placed</i> in persons, that might act separately, whereby the force of the public would be under different commands: which would be apt some time or other to cause disorder and ruin.</p>
