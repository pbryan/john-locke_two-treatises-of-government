				<p epub:type="title">Of the Extent of the Legislative Power</p>
			</hgroup>
			<p>THE great end of men’s entering into society, being the enjoyment of their properties in peace and safety, and the great instrument and means of that being the laws established in that society; the <i>first and fundamental positive law</i> of all common-wealths <i>is the establishing of the legislative</i> power; as the <i>first and fundamental natural law,</i> which is to govern even the legislative itself, <i>is the preservation of the society,</i> and (as far as will consist with the public good) of every person in it. This <i>legislative</i> is not only <i>the supreme power</i> of the common-wealth, but sacred and unalterable in the hands where the community have once placed it; nor can any edict of any body else, in what form soever conceived, or by what power soever backed, have the force and obligation of a <i>law,</i> which has not its <i>sanction from</i> that <i>legislative</i> which the public has chosen and appointed: for without this the law could not have that, which is absolutely necessary to its being a <i>law,</i><a href="#footnote_nt008" id="footnote_nt008_ref">*</a> <i>the consent of the society,</i> over whom no body can have a power to make laws, but by their own consent, and by authority received from them; and therefore all the <i>obedience,</i> which by the most solemn ties any one can be obliged <i>to</i> pay, ultimately terminates in this <i>supreme power,</i> and is directed by those laws which it enacts: nor can any oaths to any foreign power whatsoever, or any domestic subordinate power, discharge any member of the society from his <i>obedience to the legislative,</i> acting pursuant to their trust; nor oblige him to any obedience contrary to the laws so enacted, or farther than they do allow; it being ridiculous to imagine one can be tied ultimately to <i>obey</i> any <i>power</i> in the society, which is not the <i>supreme.</i></p>
			<p>Though the <i>legislative,</i> whether placed in one or more, whether it be always in being, or only by intervals, though it be the <i>supreme</i> power in every common-wealth; yet,</p>
			<p><i>First,</i> It is <i>not,</i> nor can possibly be absolutely <i>arbitrary</i> over the lives and fortunes of the people: for it being but the joint power of every member of the society given up to that person, or assembly, which is legislator; it can be no more than those persons had in a state of nature before they entered into society, and gave up to the community: for no body can transfer to another more power than he has in himself; and no body has an absolute arbitrary power over himself, or over any other, to destroy his own life, or take away the life or property of another. A man, as has been proved, cannot subject himself to the arbitrary power of another; and having in the state of nature no arbitrary power over the life, liberty, or possession of another, but only so much as the law of nature gave him for the preservation of himself, and the rest of mankind; this is all he doth, or can give up to the common-wealth, and by it to the <i>legislative power,</i> so that the legislative can have no more than this. Their power, in the utmost bounds of it, is <i>limited to the public good</i> of the society. It is a power, that hath no other end but preservation, and therefore can never<a href="#footnote_nt009" id="footnote_nt009_ref">*</a> have a right to destroy, enslave, or designedly to impoverish the subjects. The obligations of the law of nature cease not in society, but only in many cases are drawn closer, and have by human laws known penalties annexed to them, to inforce their observation. Thus the law of nature stands as an eternal rule to all men, <i>legislators</i> as well as others. The <i>rules</i> that they make for other men’s actions, must, as well as their own and other men’s actions, be conformable to the law of nature, <i>i. e.</i> to the will of God, of which that is a declaration, and the <i>fundamental law of nature being the preservation of mankind,</i> no human sanction can be good, or valid against it.</p>
			<p><i>Secondly,</i><a href="#footnote_nt010" id="footnote_nt010_ref">*</a> The <i>legislative,</i> or supreme authority, cannot assume to its self a power to rule by extemporary arbitrary decrees, but <i>is bound to dispense justice,</i> and decide the rights of the subject <i>by promulgated standing laws, and known authorized judges:</i> for the law of nature being unwritten, and so no where to be found but in the minds of men, they who through passion or interest shall miscite, or misapply it, cannot so easily be convinced of their mistake where there is no established judge: and so it serves not, as it ought, to determine the rights, and fence the properties of those that live under it, especially where every one is judge, interpreter, and executioner of it too, and that in his own case: and he that has right on his side, having ordinarily but his own single strength, hath not force enough to defend himself from injuries, or to punish delinquents. To avoid these inconveniencies, which disorder men’s properties in the state of nature, men unite into societies, that they may have the united strength of the whole society to secure and defend their properties, and may have <i>standing rules</i> to bound it, by which every one may know what is his. To this end it is that men give up all their natural power to the society which they enter into, and the community put the legislative power into such hands as they think fit, with this trust, that they shall be governed by <i>declared laws,</i> or else their peace, quiet, and property will still be at the same uncertainty, as it was in the state of nature.</p>
			<p>Absolute arbitrary power, or governing without <i>settled standing laws,</i> can neither of them consist with the ends of society and government, which men would not quit the freedom of the state of nature for, and tie themselves up under, were it not to preserve their lives, liberties and fortunes, and by <i>stated rules</i> of right and property to secure their peace and quiet. It cannot be supposed that they should intend, had they a power so to do, to give to any one, or more, an <i>absolute arbitrary power</i> over their persons and estates, and put a force into the magistrate’s hand to execute his unlimited will arbitrarily upon them. This were to put themselves into a worse condition than the state of nature, wherein they had a liberty to defend their right against the injuries of others, and were upon equal terms of force to maintain it, whether invaded by a single man, or many in combination. Whereas by supposing they have given up themselves to the <i>absolute arbitrary power</i> and will of a legislator, they have disarmed themselves, and armed him, to make a prey of them when he pleases; he being in a much worse condition, who is exposed to the arbitrary power of one man, who has the command of 100,000, than he that is exposed to the arbitrary power of 100,000 single men; no body being secure, that his will, who has such a command, is better than that of other men, though his force be 100,000 times stronger. And therefore, whatever form the commonwealth is under, the ruling power ought to govern by <i>declared</i> and <i>received laws,</i> and nor by extemporary dictates and undetermined resolutions: for then mankind will be in a far worse condition than in the state of nature, if they shall have armed one, or a few men with the joint power of a multitude, to force them to obey at pleasure the exorbitant and unlimited decrees of their sudden thoughts, or unrestrained, and till that moment unknown wills, without having any measures set down which may guide and justify their actions: for all the power the government has, being only for the good of the society, as it ought not to be <i>arbitrary</i> and at pleasure, so it ought to be exercised by <i>established and promulgated laws;</i> that both the people may know their duty, and be safe and secure within the limits of the law; and the rulers too kept within their bounds, and not be tempted, by the power they have in their hands, to employ it to such purposes, and by such measures, as they would not have known, and own not willingly.</p>
			<p><i>Thirdly,</i> The <i>supreme power cannot take</i> from any man any part of his <i>property</i> without his own consent: for the preservation of property being the end of government, and that for which men enter into society, it necessarily supposes and requires, that the people should <i>have property,</i> without which they must be supposed to lose that, by entering into society, which was the end for which they entered into it; too gross an absurdity for any man to own. <i>Men</i> therefore <i>in society having property,</i> they have such a right to the goods, which by the law of the community are their’s, that no body hath a right to take their substance or any part of it from them, without their own consent: without this they have no <i>property</i> at all; for I have truly no <i>property</i> in that, which another can by right take from me, when he pleases, against my consent. Hence it is a mistake to think, that the <i>supreme or legislative power</i> of any common-wealth, can do what it will, and dispose of the estates of the subject <i>arbitrarily,</i> or take any part of them at pleasure. This is not much to be feared in governments where the <i>legislative</i> consists, wholly or in part, in assemblies which are variable, whose members, upon the dissolution of the assembly, are subjects under the common laws of their country, equally with the rest. But in governments, where the <i>legislative</i> is in one lasting assembly always in being, or in one man, as in absolute monarchies, there is danger still, that they will think themselves to have a distinct interest from the rest of the community; and so will be apt to increase their own riches and power, by taking what they think fit from the people: for a man’s <i>property</i> is not at all secure, tho’ there be good and equitable laws to set the bounds of it between him and his fellow subjects, if he who commands those subjects have power to take from any private man, what part he pleases of his <i>property,</i> and use and dispose of it as he thinks good.</p>
			<p>But <i>government,</i> into whatsoever hands it is put, being, as I have before shewed, intrusted with this condition, and <i>for this end,</i> that men might have and secure their <i>properties;</i> the prince, or senate, however it may have power to make laws, for the regulating of <i>property</i> between the subjects one amongst another, yet can never have a power to take to themselves the whole, or any part of the subjects <i>property,</i> without their own consent: for this would be in effect to leave them no <i>property</i> at all. And to let us see, that even <i>absolute power,</i> where it is necessary, is <i>not arbitrary</i> by being absolute, but is still limited by that reason, and confined to those ends, which required it in some cases to be absolute, we need look no farther than the common practice of martial discipline: for the preservation of the army, and in it of the whole common-wealth, requires an <i>absolute obedience</i> to the command of every superior officer, and it is justly death to disobey or dispute the most dangerous or unreasonable of them; but yet we see, that neither the serjeant, that could command a soldier to march up to the mouth of a cannon, or stand in a breach, where he is almost sure to perish, can command that soldier to give him one penny of his money; nor the <i>general,</i> that can condemn him to death for deserting his post, or for not obeying the most desperate orders, can yet, with all his <i>absolute power</i> of life and death, dispose of one farthing of that soldier’s estate, or seize one jot of his goods; whom yet he can command any thing, and hang for the least disobedience; because such a blind obedience is necessary to that end, for which the commander has his power, <i>viz.</i> the preservation of the rest; but the disposing of his goods has nothing to do with it.</p>
			<p>It is true, governments cannot be supported without great charge, and it is fit every one who enjoys his share of the protection, should pay out of his estate his proportion for the maintenance of it. But still it must be with his own consent, <i>i. e.</i> the consent of the majority, giving it either by themselves, or their representatives chosen by them: for if any one shall claim a <i>power to lay</i> and levy <i>taxes</i> on the people, by his own authority, and without such consent of the people, he thereby invades the <i>fundamental law of property,</i> and subverts the end of government: for what property have I in that, which another may by right take, when he pleases, to himself?</p>
			<p><i>Fourthly,</i> The <i>legislative cannot transfer the power of making laws</i> to any other hands: for it being but a delegated power from the people, they who have it cannot pass it over to others. The people alone can appoint the form of the common-wealth, which is by constituting the legislative, and appointing in whose hands that shall be. And when the people have said, We will submit to rules, and be governed by <i>laws</i> made by such men, and in such forms, no body else can say other men shall make <i>laws</i> for them; nor can the people be bound by any <i>laws,</i> but such as are enacted by those whom they have chosen, and authorized to make <i>laws</i> for them. The power of the <i>legislative,</i> being derived from the people by a positive voluntary grant and institution, can be no other than what that positive grant conveyed, which being only to make <i>laws,</i> and not to make <i>legislators,</i> the <i>legislative</i> can have no power to transfer their authority of making laws, and place it in other hands.</p>
			<p>These are the <i>bounds</i> which the trust, that is put in them by the society, and the law of God and nature, have <i>set to the legislative</i> power of every common-wealth, in all forms of government.</p>
			<p>First, They are to govern by <i>promulgated established laws,</i> not to be varied in particular cases, but to have one rule for rich and poor, for the favourite at court, and the country man at plough.</p>
			<p>Secondly, These <i>laws</i> also ought to be designed <i>for</i> no other end ultimately, but <i>the good of the people.</i></p>
			<p>Thirdly, They must <i>not raise taxes</i> on the <i>property of the people, without the consent of the people,</i> given by themselves, or their deputies. And this properly concerns only such governments where the <i>legislative</i> is always in being, or at least where the people have not reserved any part of the legislative to deputies, to be from time to time chosen by themselves.</p>
			<p>Fourthly, The <i>legislative</i> neither must <i>nor can transfer the power of making laws</i> to any body else, or place it any where, but where the people have.</p>
